# My handouts
Here are some things I've written/helped write.

# Euclid's Orchard
In 2020, I banded together with a group of students to write some handouts intended for the [AoPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/) community. Here is our work.

## General
- [One Page Summaries (unfinished)](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-onepagers.pdf): Written by me. This was a project to condense one topic into one page by picking what we thought was important. This is by no means a comprehensive guide -- it is one page after all! **Note:** The project is unfinished and there are currently no plans to finish it.

## AMC-AIME Level
- [Recursion in the AIME](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-recursion.pdf): Written by Jeffrey Chen, with edits by Peter Pu. A nice introductory handout to the idea of forming and solving recursions.
- [Modular Arithmetic in the AMC and AIME](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-mods.pdf): Written by me to introduce modular arithmetic. Goes over most concepts in modular arithmetic, although some overlapping topics with other parts of number theory may have been left out.
- [Sequences and Series in the AMC and AIME](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-sequences.pdf): Written by nikenissan and me. Covers arithmetic, geometric, arithmetico-geometric, telescoping, and recursive sequences. Note that recursive sequences is briefly mentioned, since we already have an article on recursion.

## AIME-USA(J)MO Level
- [Polynomials in the AIME](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-polynomials.pdf): Written by naman12 and me. A complete guide on how to use polynomials on the AIME. Includes (almost) every polynomial problem on the AIME and also problems from other sources (such as RMO and HMMT).
- [Standard Proof Techniques](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-polynomials.pdf): Written by Jai Sharma. Introduces proof techniques any olympiad student should know.
- [Trigonometry in the AIME and USA(J)MO](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-trigonometry.pdf): Written by naman12 and me. A complete guide on how to use trigonometry on the AIME and USA(J)MO. Includes (almost) every trigonometry problem on the AIME, with worked out problems as well as more than one hundred hints to selected problems. There are quite a few olympiad problems sprinkled in, too.

## Higher Math
- [Group Theory](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-grouptheory.pdf): Written by Emma Cardwell and Matthew Ho. It is an introductory piece covering the basic ideas of group theory.
