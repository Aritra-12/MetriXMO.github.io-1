# My handouts
Here are some things I've written/helped write.

# Euclid's Orchard
In 2020, I banded together with a group of students to write some handouts intended for the [AoPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/) community. Here is our work.
- [One Page Summaries (unfinished)](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-onepagers.pdf): Written by me. This was a project to condense one topic into one page by picking what we thought was important. This is by no means a comprehensive guide -- it is one page after all! **Note:** The project is unfinished and there are currently no plans to finish it.
